The goal of the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project is to understand "how cells respond to various genetic and environmental stressors", to gain a greater "understanding of cell pathways", and to "aid efforts to develop therapies that might restore perturbed pathways and networks to their normal states." This particular data contains Level 4 gene-expression values, which are "Z-scores for each gene based on" Level 3 data "with respect to the population of vehicle controls". Additionally, we mapped the probe identifiers to gene symbols for easier interpretation and included cell line metadata. If you are interested in this dataset, you may also be interested in the LINCS Level 3 or Level 5 data as well as the Connectivity Map data.

##Gene Expression Profiling of Normal Mouse Skin, Hras WT and Hras -/-

This data set contains the transcriptional profiles of 20 dorsal skin samples from eight-week-old mice. Mice were generated by crossing FVB/N to Mus spretus mice to generate F1 mice, and then crossing F1 mice back to the FVB/N strain. 10  FVB/N mice lacking Hras1 (aka HrasKO, Hras-/-) and 10  FVB/N mice with wild-type Hras1 were generated.(https://ocg.cancer.gov/ctd2-data-project/university-california-san-francisco-ucsf-2-gene-expression-profiling-normal-mouse)

These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE63885. "The introduction of microarray techniques to cancer research brought great expectations for finding biomarkers that would improve patients' treatment; however, the results of such studies are poorly reproducible and critical analyses of these methods are rare. In this study, we examined global gene expression in 97 ovarian cancer samples."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.

Per the Broad Institute: "The Connectivity Map (also known as cmap) is a collection of genome-wide transcriptional expression data from cultured human cells treated with bioactive small molecules and simple pattern-matching algorithms that together enable the discovery of functional connections between drugs, genes and diseases through the transitory feature of common gene-expression changes." This dataset contains build 02 of the data, which we have summarized to gene-level values (using Entrez Gene annotations). We normalized the data using the SCAN algorithm. Please note that the LINCS datasets are newer and contain much more experimental data.
